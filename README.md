# Simple file sharing with ngrok

This repository should be used if you want to share files without uploading in a cloud (like WeTransfer, Dropbox, Google Drive) and you want to serve them directly from your computer.

You need to register with ngrok and download the client for your OS.

This is the official website: https://ngrok.com/

When you're ready to run servers with ngrok open two different terminal tabs and run:

```
npm start
./ngrok http 3000
```

You're ready! ngrok will answer with your unique URL:

Enjoy! :smile:
